This project is designed for Students, Faculty, and Admins to access the database and review Student grades and enrollment.

Each user should be able to perform the following:
1. Access the database and review the specified values they are permitted to percieve (Grades, Enrollment Status, etc.)
2. Specify the percieved data by either classroom, course, faculty (for Admin and Student), and student(for Admin and Faculty)

Admins and Faculty will gain these additional features:
1. Modify specific grades and enrollment statuses for each student they are permitted to modify
2. Update the status of courses they are permitted to modify
3. Update the room-course relationship of each course they are permitted to modify

Admins will gain the additional features:
1. Modify the status of rooms and their capacity
2. Assign the Faculty to their Departments
3. Change the permissions of Faculty and the Students they have access to
4. Archive previous Semesters and modify the current Semester
